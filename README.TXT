  * for 3 services and 5 products related to each of the services.
  *
  * The services and products loaded up at the start of the application from the products_and_services.csv file.
  * The program works that way that many more products and services can be added and there is no need to change anything in the main method, 
  * because the program know the structure and do not rely on the positions of the data elements. 
  * So if I want to add more services and more products to the products_and_services.csv file., the program will continue working
  * with no need to change anything in the main code. 
  * 
  * The total bill is recorded to the billing.txt and all the reports (Customer,Services,Sales)
