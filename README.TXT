  * The Cumputer Store Aplication program  
  * Currently this application shows the use of 3 services and 5 products related to each of the services. However, as described below the number of
  * products and services does not need to be fixed, it is dynamic and can be changed any time.  
  *
  * The services and products loaded up at the start of the application from the products_and_services.csv file.
  * The program works that way that many more products and services can be added with out the need to change anything in the main method. 
  * The program know the structure and do not rely on the positions of the data elements. 
  * So if I want to add more services and/or products the program will continue working with no need to change anything in the main code. 
  * 
  * The total bill is recorded to the billing.txt. All reports (Customer,Services,Sales) 
  * read the data from this file and display relevant data in the manager tab.
